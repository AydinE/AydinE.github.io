I'm Aydin Erdas, a professional developer since 2017, avid gamer for as long as I can remember and recently sailing enthusiast.

## Work
I have recently decided to quit my fulltime job and have started working as an independent consultant for [Esports Mogul](https://mogul.gg/), a very cool company where I get to work on a global Esports tournament platform as a full stack developer.

## AFK
During time spent away from my keyboard I like to go for a run, travel and sail. Some day when I have all the right certifications and a bit more practice 
I would like to combine the last 2.
